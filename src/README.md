Metacognition encompasses a wide range of mental activities, including self-reflection, self-evaluation, and self-regulation. It allows us to analyze our strengths and weaknesses, identify areas for improvement, and devise action plans to overcome challenges. By engaging in metacognitive practices, we can take control of our learning experiences and become active participants in our own educational journeys.

Throughout this book, we will explore various metacognitive techniques, strategies, and exercises that can be applied across different domains of knowledge.
