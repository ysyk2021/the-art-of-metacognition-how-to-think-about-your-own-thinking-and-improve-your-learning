Metacognition is the ability to think about one's own thinking. It involves being aware of our own thought processes, monitoring our own understanding and learning, and making adjustments as needed. This chapter will provide an overview of how metacognition can enhance learning and problem-solving, as well as a more in-depth definition of metacognition.

Defining Metacognition
----------------------

Metacognition refers to the awareness and control of our own cognitive processes. It includes monitoring, planning, and evaluating our own thinking processes. By being aware of our own thinking processes, we can identify areas where we need to improve our understanding and take steps to address these gaps.

Overview of How Metacognition Can Enhance Learning and Problem-Solving
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Metacognition can enhance learning and problem-solving in a variety of ways. By being aware of our own thinking processes, we can identify biases or faulty assumptions that may be hindering problem-solving efforts. We can adjust our approach accordingly and consider alternative solutions.

Metacognition can also improve self-regulation, which is the ability to control our own behavior and emotions. By being aware of our own thinking processes and emotions, we can regulate our own behavior and make better decisions.

Overall, metacognition is an essential component of learning and problem-solving. By applying metacognition to academic settings and everyday life, learners can become more effective problem-solvers and learners.
